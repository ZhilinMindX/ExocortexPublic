# Claim Ledger — Structured Verification

// [L2] SCOPE:Meta;STATE:Active;ORIGIN:Assimilated-from-claude-obsidian(claim-ledgers)

## Purpose
Key assertions used by the Council get structured, reviewable entries.
Prose persuades; ledgers track. Pairs with [[001-Meta/TrajectoryBank]]
(decisions) and auto source-tiering (two failed checks -> demotion, no deliberation).

## Entry Template

    ### CLAIM-NNN
    - CLAIM: one sentence, falsifiable
    - SOURCE: [[book/page]] or URL; tier: VERIFIED | SHELF | UNVERIFIED
    - CONFIDENCE: HIGH | MED | LOW
    - SUPPORT: what backs it
    - CONTRADICTED-BY: what cuts against it (empty = unchecked, not "none")
    - LAST-REVIEWED: YYYY-MM-DD
    - STATUS: ACTIVE | DEMOTED | RETIRED

## Log

### CLAIM-001
- CLAIM: "The ends justify the means" is NOT a Machiavelli quote — a mistranslation.
- SOURCE: A10 The Prince (Oxford), p.160 — 'in spite of some English translations
  to the contrary, Machiavelli never said that the ends justify the means'
- CONFIDENCE: HIGH
- SUPPORT: Oxford edition editorial note; si guarda al fine passage analysis
- CONTRADICTED-BY: popular attribution everywhere (usage, not text)
- LAST-REVIEWED: 2026-09-07
- STATUS: ACTIVE

### CLAIM-002
- CLAIM: "In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity" is NOT a Sun Tzu quote.
- SOURCE: A11 The Art of War (Giles, 1910 PD, full text) — zero hits for "chaos"/"opportunity"
  phrasing across all 154 chunks; verse-level inspection
- CONFIDENCE: MEDIUM-HIGH
- SUPPORT: full-text absence in the standard PD translation; known as modern internet paraphrase
- CONTRADICTED-BY: not located in any classical commentary within A11
- LAST-REVIEWED: 2026-09-07
- STATUS: ACTIVE
- NOTE: member Sun Tzu must never use it (StyleSheet-SunTzu §5). Limitation: absence shown
  for Giles only; a second PD translation cross-check remains open.

[RECAP] Every load-bearing claim: sourced, tiered, dated, falsifiable.
